I'm a second year thesis-based master student from [SIAT](https://www.siat.ac.cn/), [UCAS](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/). 
My research interest includes deep learning, computer vision, security and privacy.
I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xitong Gao](https://admk.github.io/) of [Cloud Computing Center](http://cloud.siat.ac.cn/cloud/).

Recently,  my research has focused on Trustworthy AI, including adversarial samples, backdoor attacks, data poisoning, etc.
